            <h2 class="featurette-heading">1. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (8th Gen)<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Lenovo didn't make many changes to our favorite business laptop but the new ThinkPad X1 Carbon now flaunts Intel 10th Gen CPUs. On top of delivering fast performance, you get long battery life (on the 1080p model) and two gorgeous, 1080p and 4K display options, all in an impossibly lightweight chassis (2.4 pounds). 

              But it's still those classic ThinkPad features —  a durable design (with MIL-STD-810G strength), best-in-class keyboard and stealthy black/red aesthetics — that carry the X1 Carbon to greatness.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">2. Lenovo ThinkPad X13 (AMD)<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">A Lenovo business laptop for under $1,000? It's time to have a chat with your IT manager. The budget-friendly ThinkPad X13 with AMD chips delivers some of the best elements of the ThinkPad lineup at a much lower price than we're used to. 

              Some of those features include a portable, minimalist chassis with military-grade durability, an outstanding keyboard and plenty of security features, including a fingerprint sensor and IR camera. And thanks to its AMD Ryzen CPUs, the ThinkPad X13 has incredible performance at this price. The only major downside is the subpar battery life, but around 8 hours isn't terrible. </p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">3. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga (5th Gen, 2020)<span class="text-muted">.</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Lenovo took a chance with the ThinkPad X1 Yoga, the first metal ThinkPad, and it paid off. While we still love the signature matte-black carbon-fiber found on most ThinkPads, the aluminum and magnesium ThinkPad X1 Yoga is a gorgeous change of pace. Not only does it have a slim design, but this convertible 2-in-1 flaunts a bright display and offers a best-in-class keyboard and long battery life. These combine to make the best Lenovo laptop for anyone who those looking for a convertible. 

              You also get loads of extra goodies, like a built-in stylus slot and webcam cover. We still love the ThinkPad X1 Carbon for its super-lightweight chassis, but you should definitely get the Yoga instead if you want to use a stylus.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">4. Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme (Gen 2)<span class="text-muted"></span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Lenovo's high-end consumer business laptop, the ThinkPad X1 Extreme (Gen 2) has a jaw-dropping 15.6-inch 4K HDR display and blazingly fast performance thanks to its 9th Gen Core i7 CPU and quick SSD. A luxurious and durable design combined with an excellent keyboard makes the ThinkPad X1 Extreme one impressive piece of hardware. 

              The X1 Extreme delivers more power than the X1 Carbon or X1 Yoga thanks to its six-core H-series processors. It also has a larger screen and more ports, making it a better laptop for productivity. And yet, at 3.8 pounds, this machine is still very portable. Just be aware of the limited battery life on the 4K model.</p>

            <p class="lead">Graphics professionals and 3D modelers who need a laptop that can handle demanding programs should opt for the Lenovo ThinkPad P1. This sleek 15.6-inch workstation is a desktop replacement in every sense of the phrase. With a Xeon CPU and Quadro graphics, the beastly P1 offers excellent performance. Not to mention, the vivid 4K display and comfortable keyboard are some of the best we've ever seen. </p>
